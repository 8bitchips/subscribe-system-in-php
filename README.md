A user can subscribe and unsubscribe at any time. We have created a feature for subscribing with a form and unsubscribing with a link. 
We have used bootstrap to create a responsive subscribe form. We have used jQuery to reduce the JS code lines also we have used the ajax() method to 
execute PHP code without page refreshing.
